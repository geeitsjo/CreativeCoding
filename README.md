# CreativeCoding

The aim of this project is to create intricate images using code, some of this art would take a long time to create by hand or in 
Illustrator. I did this to let others know how code can be super easy to use when designing intricate images with really thin lines 
or millions of lines need to be used. I also want to portray that coding is very creative industry, most people think itâ€™s all about 
maths and logical thinking but there is also a massive degree of creativeness for people to code.
